            <div class="description-content">
                <p>A grilled cheese, sometimes known as a toasted sandwich, cheese toastie (UK), or jaffle (AU-en), is a hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of bread with a cooking fat such as butter or mayonnaise on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns and the cheese melts.</p>
                <p>The 1861 English recipe book Mrs. Beeton's Book of Household Management includes a recipe for placing sandwiches of bread and butter with 1‚ÅÑ2-inch (13 mm) slices of "a nice fat Cheshire or any good rich cheese" into an oven, and serving when the bread becomes toasted.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>8 slices white sandwich bread</li>
                <li>4 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons softened butter, or as needed</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
            <li>Spread a thin layer of butter onto 1 side of each slice of bread.</li>
            <li>Using a round cookie cutter that is slightly smaller than the sandwich sealer, press out round slices of cheese. Lay 4 slices of bread on a work surface, buttered side down. Place a cheese round in the center of each slice. Top with remaining 4 bread slices, buttered side up.</li>
            <li>Center a sandwich sealer over a sandwich, press the sealer down, and hold it in place to seal the edges, 15 to 30 seconds. Pull the crusts away from the sealer; discard. Repeat with remaining sandwiches.</li>
            <li>Place sandwich discs on a parchment-lined baking sheet and freeze for 2 hours before transferring into a freezer bag.</li>
            <li>Preheat the air fryer to 380 degrees F (193 degrees C). Cook frozen sandwiches until golden, about 5 minutes. If sandwiches are thawed, cook 3 minutes at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C).</li>
